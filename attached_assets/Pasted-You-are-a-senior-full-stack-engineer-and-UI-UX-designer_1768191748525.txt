You are a senior full-stack engineer and UI/UX designer.

Build a COMPLETE, PORTABLE Full Stack Web Application titled:

“Placement Interaction System to Track Placement Records”
(FSAD-PS14)

========================
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
========================
1. The project MUST run IDENTICALLY:
   - on Replit
   - after extracting the source code locally
2. NO Replit-specific databases or services.
3. The project MUST run with a single command:
   docker-compose up
4. No manual DB creation, no environment-specific hacks.
5. Clean, academic-friendly, viva-safe code.

========================
TECH STACK (STRICT)
========================
Frontend:
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Lucide Icons
- Framer Motion (subtle animations only)

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Prisma ORM

Database:
- PostgreSQL (Docker container, NOT Replit built-in)

Infrastructure:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- .env configuration

Authentication:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Password hashing (bcrypt)

========================
UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
========================
The UI must be MODERN, CUTE, and BEAUTIFUL — not boring.

Design Style:
- Soft pastel theme
- Rounded corners (2xl)
- Gradient headers/navbars
- Clean cards instead of ugly tables
- Subtle hover animations
- Friendly but professional look

Color Palette:
- Primary: Indigo (#6366F1)
- Accent: Pink (#EC4899)
- Background: Light grey (#F9FAFB)
- Cards: White
- Success: Green
- Warning: Yellow
- Danger: Red

UI Components:
- shadcn/ui for buttons, cards, dialogs, tables
- Lucide icons everywhere (clean, consistent)
- Framer Motion for fade/slide/hover animations
- Loading skeletons
- Empty-state messages

The app should look like a REAL startup product, not a basic college CRUD app.

========================
USER ROLES (RBAC)
========================
- Admin
- Student
- Employer

Implement proper role-based access control.
